# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
<!-- Explain the purpose of the new analysis.-->
After showing the CEO V.Isualize what we can do. He has given Omar and I a new task with two deliverabales. (See below)

1. Creating a new summary Datafile showing the following fields.
   - Total Rides by City Type.
   - Total Drivers by City Type.
   - Total Fares by City Type.
   - Average Fare per Ride by City Type.
   - Average Fare per Driver by City Type.
2. Create a line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, where each City type has its own line in the graph.

## Results
<!--Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.-->
Deliverable 1 Results

Looking at the results for Deliverable 1, there are some interesting results. The distribution between city types is extremely large. There is a very clear inverse relationship betweeen the number of rides and average fares. While Rural rides account for 125(about 5%) total rides. They have the highest averages fare per driver. While Urban Ridies have the smaller average fare, being 16 compared to 55 dollars, which is almost a 4 to 1 difference. Another really stark observation is the difference in drivers to rides, the Urban areas, have almost and excess thousand drivers to rides, making profit for each driver extremely low, while Urban rides account for the most money.

The Results from deliverable one show are very powerful story about the profit gained from rural and suburban rides, while Deliverable 2 shows a very different story.

In Deliverable 2, it shows that Urban fares bring in the largest percent of money at every point on the graph. Urban fares have the most consistent upward trend among the three city types, while the Suburban market, has the largest spikes. It would be interesting to see what happened causing the jumps in late february.

## Summary
<!--Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.-->
Looking at the two deliverables, I would share a few different recommendations. The first recommendation is too look into the spikes near, the end of February, all three city types spiked, at that time, See if there was an event correlated to that, and if you can use incentives or marketing to make, the next event similar bring a larger spike. Second, I would share with driver's the locations that are currently bringing the largest fare, so that you have a better distribution of driver's in the places where rides are available. This will allow for more growth in Rural\Suburban City locations, and give Drivers more opportunities for higher fare rides.

The Rural city location is probably the most interesting in the Data, in that it has a week where it made no money, but each ride it does have has a large profit for the driver and Pyber. I would look to see if there are ways to find drivers for the rides that were missed, or tailor ways for Rural users of Pyber to connect with a driver.
